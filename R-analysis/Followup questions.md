## Advanced Terminal Use and Configuration
**Follow-up questions**
1. Youâ€™ve found a new bioinformatics package on GitHub. What is the sequence of commands to clone the package code into your home directory? Can you think of any advantages to reading or modifying code sourced from others?  

2.	We discussed several major software projects hosted (at least in part) on GitHub. Find two other interesting software hosted on GitHub. Fields of interest could include bioinformatics, major software (e.g. web serving, scientific computing, or other projects), or other packages. The programming language of choice can be any you have interest in.

3. What is the sequence of commands we used to create a tarball, copy it securely to another host (i.e., scp or other command to move the file between computers), and untar the archive? (HINT: Review the commands in `analysis_pipeline.sh`). Are there other ways to achieve the same result?

4. There were three main programs invoked to compile R in the user directory. What were the three programs, and what arguments were needed?

5. How can you list environment variables in your current terminal session? How can you create or modify environment variables?

6. What does modifying the $PATH variable help to do? What about other components of the .bashrc/.bash_profile files?
